If you have found a translation error or got an improvement
suggestion, please tell me - http://chcounter.org/index.php?s=kontakt
Thanks!



New translations
==============
If you want to create a new translation, here is a guide:


All language files are located in the directory "languages" and there
within a sub directory named after the ISO639-1 code of each language
(see http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639).

Example: English -> "en", German => "de"

Create a new directory named after the ISO639-1 code of the language
and copy the language files of an already existent translation into it.


Format and charset of the language files
------------------------------------------------
All files are plan text files and can be opened with every text editor.
All files must be saved using the UTF-8 charset.
Regarding Windows: You may use e.g. Notepad2
(http://www.flos-freeware.ch) or UniRed
(http://www.esperanto.mv.ru/UniRed/ENG/index.html).
But Windows' build-in programm Notepad should be capable, too.


lang_name.txt
-----------------
In this file the name of the language must be noted. This name will be
used by the select lists for the languages in the administration area
and in the statistics pages.



main.lang.php, administration.lang.php, install.lang.php
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These files contain all strings that have to be translated in the
following format:

'identifier' => 'string that needs to be translated',

or

'identifier' => "string that needs to be translated",

Please do not change the existent HTML tags of some strings - except of
line breaks ("<br />") if customisations is needed to keep the layout
clear.

If one of the following chars occurs within a string, it must be
escaped with a backslash \:

- double or single quotes - depending on how the string is enclosed.
  Examples:
  'word \' word'
  "word \"word"

- Backslashes:  \
- dollar signs: $, if the string is enclosed by double quotes


Furthermore, there are some special combinations:
- %s
- %1$s, %2$s, ...
These character string will be replaced later with others (the context
should make their individual meaning clear). In this case (and only
there), a backslash must NOT be noted before the dollar sign.


config.inc.php
-----------------
In addition to date formats these settings have to customized:

'translator'	-	Name of the translator (optional). Will be shown (in the
			default template) next to the copyright notice.

'lang_code'	-	The ISO639-1 code of the language

'decimal_separator' -	Decimal separator of numbers
'thousands_separator' -	Thousands separator of numbers




images/all_entries_xx.png
----------------------
Now a file called "all_entries_xx.png" (xx stands for the ISO639-1-Code
of the language) must be created using the same layout as the already
existant images - it is sufficient to send me the translated writing of
the image.
