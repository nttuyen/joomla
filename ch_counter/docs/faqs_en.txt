 FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions
=======================


- I installed the chCounter, but it does not count every page!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The counter must be integrated into every file that you want to be
counted. Only if the counter is included, the script will
be executed when someone request the respective file - and the
visitor thus counted.



- I noted the PHP code within a file, but the counter does not work,
  and only the PHP code is displayed in the source code!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see file install_en.txt, chapter 3.2: integration with PHP



- Neither referrers nor search engines and keywords are displayed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a) If you use frames:
Include the counter as well into the file with the frameset. If the
counter is only included into a frame, the referrer will always be your
one page with the frameset and not the foreign page anymore.
b) see FAQ "The counter doesn't count, there is always only one visitor
online, ...!"



- The counter doesn't count, there is always only one visitor online,
   only page views are counted, ...!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Probably you include the counter using the complete HTTP address, e.g.
include("http://www.homepage.tld/counter/counter.php");
-> the counter must be included via the file system of the web server.



- I have lost my user name/password and cannot login anymore!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With the script set_new_login_data.php (in the "install" directory,
must be executed within that directory) you can set a new user name and
a new password.
